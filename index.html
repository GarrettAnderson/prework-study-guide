              A web application is an application, accessed via a web browser, that allows users to perform tasks on the internet.
            </li>

              HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
              An element is a type of content on a webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition to elements that can be seen on the page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.
            </li>
            <li>
              HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
              The "head" element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the "head" are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
              In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.
